            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that you can take advantage of to help you use files and records to the fullest extent. When you are using version control, you can look back at previous versions of the file, so you can see what you changed with every step you took to make the file what it has become presently. This system is very helpful to people who are graphic designers, because it can helps them see how the image or design they are making has progressed from where they started to where they are now. It is also extremely helpful to understand why certain problems have been caused, and you can easily go back and fix the issue.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git started in 2005, when Linux had to develop their own tool when their relationship with another company ended, as did the use of their product. When Linux decided to make their new tool, they wanted it to be very useful and effective in certain categories. They wanted this tool to be very fast, with a simple design. Another essential for this program was for it to have a strong support for non-linear development, with thousands of parallel branches. Linux also wanted to make sure that their new software could be fully distributed, and able to handle very large projects efficiently.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What makes it different?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a program that deals with memorizing data, but not in a traditional way. Git basically takes snapshots of all of your files and data whenever you save, so you can go back and look at exactly what your work looked like at that point. A good part about this is that Git operations are almost always local, so you don’t need any other computers to help save your files. This also helps with how quickly Git operates. Since it does not have to reach out and connect to a server to get all of the files that it has previously saved, it saves all the time that it would take to do that.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Three States of Git
                <span class="text-muted">How will we encounter it?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three main states that you will see Git in. These three states are committed, modified, and staged. When Git is committed, that means that all of your data is saved and stored in the local database of your computer or device. Every time that Git is in its modified stage, that is when a change has been made to a committed save, but before the change has been saved. The third stage of Git is when your work is staged. This is when you save your work and get it ready to be snapshotted once again. These three stages are how Git makes sure to keep saving your work whenever you want it to be updated.

                <span class="text-muted">How to keep it all in check</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">All the files that you are working with can be labeled as either tracked or untracked. If they are tracked, that means that they are just the files that were in the most recent snapshot that you took, and untracked files are anything that you are currently working on, that hasn’t been added into a new snapshot yet. You can also keep yourself informed on the status of your files, with the git status command. This will help you be able to tell which files are in which state, and keeps an organized list of all of the states. There are also many other functions of Git that you can use to monitor the status of your program and the work you have done.
